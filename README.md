# Unofficial EVE Jukebox

The Unofficial EVE Jukebox is a no-frills mp3 player that can play custom playlists based on where you are in the EVE universe.

Linux and Windows builds available. Should compile on OSX, maybe? It's C++ and QT5. I don't have OSX.

## FAQ

1. Why use this instead of my regular mp3 player?

Because a regular mp3 player can not play different music based on where you are.

2. Can I have a playlist for systems owned by my alliance?

Yes

3. Can I have different playlists for stations?

Yes

4. Can I have different playlists for POSes?

No. I don't think this is possible.

5. How does the player interact with the game?

The player monitors the game's log file. It does not interact with the client in any way. This is not a mod, and you will not be banned for using it.

6. Does it react to combat?

The log file does contain notices when you receive damage, but that's not really the same thing as knowing when combat starts and when it ends. Needs to be investigated.

7. Does it react to mission sites?

Not at the moment.

8. Can I share streams?

Maybe? Haven't tested it yet
